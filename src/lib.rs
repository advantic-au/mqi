//! Overview
//! --------
//! Idiomatic Rust API's to the IBMÂ® MQ Interface (MQI) and MQ Administration Interface (MQAI).
//!
//! You can use `mqi` to:
//!
//! - Connect to an IBM MQ server to send and receive MQ messages through the MQI functions
//! - Administer IBM MQ server through the MQAI functions
//!
//! This crate depends and the [libmqm-sys](https://crates.io/crates/libmqm-sys) crate for
//! connectivity to MQ queue managers. The underlying connection uses the IBM supplied MQ libraries,
//! offering proven stability and performance.
